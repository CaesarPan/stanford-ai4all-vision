# Mapping Poverty with Computer Vision <br/> Stanford AI4ALL 2019

## Prerequisites

First, create a virtual environment.
`python3 -m venv .env`

Activate the virtual environment.
`source .env/bin/activate`

Navigate into the `notebooks/` folder.
`cd notebooks/`

Install the dependencies.
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Instructions for Day 1

First, open the terminal and run the following commands:

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/CaesarPan/stanford-ai4all-vision.git #(some of you have already done this in the class)
```

Now if you type `ls`, you should see a folder called `stanford-ai4all-vision` (this is where we're going to put all our work in the next two weeks!)

Here for a quick wrapup, `cd directory_path` is how you move into another folder (you should replace `directory_path` with the path of the folder you wanna go); while `ls` is the command for listing all the file names under the current folder you're at.

After you've done all of these, you now want to navigate into our work folder! Let's do this by `cd stanford-ai4all-vision`.

Now you're inside of this repo, just type `jupyter notebook` to do the same magic we did in the class. (remember to start jupyter notebook inside `stanford-ai4all-vision` folder!)

You're ready for the homework at this point. Get started!

You can find the slides for Day 1 at:

## Instructions for Day 2

**Important: DON'T use any git command from today!!**

First go to our shared Google Drive and enter our folder `Mapping Global Poverty`. The slides are under the `Slides` folder and will be continuously updated.

Then for Day 2's homework, first download everything under the `Homework -> Day 2` folder (including one `machine_learning` folder and one `utils` folder as well as a `machine_learning.ipynb` file).

Next, put all of these stuffs under the folder `notebooks`, which is under `stanford-ai4all-vision` you got yesterday (note that you already have a `utils` folder, so just copy paste all files under the new `utils` you just downloaded into the original `utils` folder).

Now you should have everything set up. For today's homework you just need to finish `machine_learning.ipynb`, which requires you to finish several functions defined in `machine_learning/model_helpers.py`.

Have fun!

## Instructions for Day 3

Today's homework is to finish `image_ops.ipynb` which is under `Day 3` folder in our shared Google Drive.

Also you can find the `numpy_tutorial.ipynb` we used in today's work session in the same place.
