# Mapping Poverty with Computer Vision <br/> Stanford AI4ALL 2019

## Prerequisites

First, create a virtual environment.
`python3 -m venv .env`

Activate the virtual environment.
`source .env/bin/activate`

Navigate into the `notebooks/` folder.
`cd notebooks/`

Install the dependencies.
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Instructions for Day 1

First, open the terminal and run the following commands:

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/CaesarPan/stanford-ai4all-vision.git #(some of you have already done this in the class)
```

Now if you type `ls`, you should see a folder called `stanford-ai4all-vision` (this is where we're going to put all our work in the next two weeks!)

Here for a quick wrapup, `cd directory_path` is how you move into another folder (you should replace `directory_path` with the path of the folder you wanna go); while `ls` is the command for listing all the file names under the current folder you're at.

After you've done all of these, you now want to navigate into our work folder! Let's do this by `cd stanford-ai4all-vision`.

Now you're inside of this repo, just type `jupyter notebook` to do the same magic we did in the class.

You're ready for the homework at this point. Get started!
